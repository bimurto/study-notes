# Pandas


#### DataFrame
A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional data structure that can store data of different types (including characters, integers, floating point values, categorical data and more) in columns. It is similar to a spreadsheet, a SQL table or the data.frame in R.

Each column in a DataFrame is a Series.

#### Read and Write
pandas supports the integration with many file formats or data sources out of the box (csv, excel, sql, json, parquet,â€¦). Importing data from each of these data sources is provided by function with the prefix read_*. Similarly, the to_* methods are used to store data.
